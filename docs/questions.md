# Questions to be addressed by the module

This page lists questions that can be asked of the Genie data. Not all of them
are already covered by the current library, so this document is also a support
for the further development of the package.

1. What is the frequency of any mutation of a gene per indication?
2. What is the frequency of each amino acid change of a gene across the complete
   GENIE patient population?
3. What is the frequency of each amino acid change of a gene per indication?
4. What is the frequency of a particular mutation/group of mutations per
   indication?
5. What is the frequency of homozygous loss of a gene per indication?
6. What is the overlap of the mutation of interest in a certain indication with
   other actionable mutations/drivers?
